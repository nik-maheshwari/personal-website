Below are some of the tutoring areas I cover - 

### Data Science projects

A typical data science project involves data gathering, data preprocessing, exploratory data analyses, machine learning models, and data visualisation. Depending upon the type of project and your prior level of knowledge/skills, a machine learning project will vary in time to completion.

### Programming fundamentals

I have been coding since I was 15 years old, and have knowledge of scripting languages such as C, C++, Java, Perl, etc. and advanced knowledge of and experience with R and Python.

If you are interested in availing any of the above services, or anything not mentioned here but is related to `data science/programming`, contact me for a free initial consultation using the form [here]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}). Please provide as much information as possible and I will get back to you within 24 hours. If I believe I can cover what you require, I will take on the tutoring task. I have 100% success rate in project completions till date (I even completed my PhD thesis 1 week before the deadline!).

#### __DISCLAIMER__ 
I only tutor part-time as I have a full time job. Any code provided by me is for tutoring purpose only (unless the project's scope is a production level solution), and I claim no responsibility of the code's implementation in production environment.
As a career coach, I can't guarantee that you will land a job, but you would come out stronger!
