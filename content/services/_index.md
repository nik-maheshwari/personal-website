I am passionate about teaching data science to students and professionals in my free time, and have been doing so for the last 4+ years. I started off by teaching maths and science to school and college students, and I eventually found my niche area of teaching in `data science` and `programming`. I solely focus on these two areas on a case-by-case basis, so for any informal queries, give me a shout [here]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}).

Few things to note -

* __Location__ - `Dublin, Ireland`
* __Mode of teaching__ - `In-person`, `Remote`
* __Pricing__ - `â‚¬50/hr` per session
  + Online session - Payment required prior to the session
  + In-person session - Payment required onsite

Below are some of the tutoring areas I cover - 

### Data Science projects

A typical data science project involves data gathering, data preprocessing, exploratory data analyses, machine learning models, and data visualisation. Depending upon the type of project and your prior level of knowledge/skills, a machine learning project will vary in time to completion.

### Big Data projects

A big data project has basically the same structure as a data science project (see above), but it applies to big datasets which adds to complexity. Common skills used in such projects are the likes of Hadoop and Spark. One can learn big data analytics on their laptop with a successful installation of Hadoop and Spark, which would be the starting point.

### General programming

I have been coding since I was 15 years old, and have knowledge of scripting languages such as C, C++, Java, Perl, etc. and advanced knowledge of and experience with R and Python.

If you are interested in availing any of the above services, or anything not mentioned here but is related to `data science/programming`, please contact me for a free initial consultation using the form [here]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}). Please provide as much information as possible and I will get back to you within 24 hours. If I believe I can cover what you require, I will take on the tutoring task. I have 100% success rate in project completions till date (I even completed my PhD thesis 1 week before the deadline!).

### __DISCLAIMER__ I only tutor part-time as I have a full time job. At no point will I mix data/code from tutoring with my work and vice-versa. Any software code provided by me is for tutoring purpose only, and I claim no responsibility of the code's implementation in production environment.
