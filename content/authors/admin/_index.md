Nikunj Maheshwari works as a manager in Data Science and Analytics department of Group Internal Audit at Bank of Ireland, Dublin. Prior to this role, he was a software developer/data scientist at [NIBRT](https://www.nibrt.ie), working on application of big data analytics in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Before NIBRT, he developed predictive pathogenic risk models for 5 leading Irish food manufacturers, which is under patent processing.

Nikunj holds a PhD in Computational Infection Biology where he computationally mined for lanthipeptide `antimicrobial` peptides from ~3000 `bacterial` genomes. He studied these peptide's evolution over time and between different bacterial taxonomy. The genome mining pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/nik-maheshwari/genome-mining). His other research projects include prediction of protein-protein interaction (during his Masters) and development of a [webserver](https://www.jpsr.pharmainfo.in/Documents/Volumes/vol3Issue12/jpsr%2003111204.pdf) to predict classes of snake `toxins`.

Apart from working full time, Nikunj enjoys `tutoring` data science and computer science fundamentals to students and professionals. You can check out his public profile [here](https://www.firsttutors.com/ireland/tutor/nikunj.maths.computer-skills/). Nikunj can help you with your data science assignments/projects, please see [Services](/services) for more information or use the [Contact form](/#contact) for a free consultation.
