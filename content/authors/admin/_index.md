Nikunj Maheshwari is a data scientist having worked in biotech, food, pharma and finance industry. Currently, Nikunj works at EY Ireland as a Senior Manager in data science. In his free time, he also creates guided projects for Coursera on topics related to data science, machine learning and statistics. Previously, he has worked at Bank of Ireland, NIBRT and UCD in various data scientist/modelling roles.

Nikunj holds a PhD in Computational Infection Biology where he computationally mined for lanthipeptide `antimicrobial` peptides from ~3000 `bacterial` genomes. He studied these peptide's evolution over time and between different bacterial taxonomy. The genome mining pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/nik-maheshwari/genome-mining). His other research projects include prediction of protein-protein interaction (during his Masters) and development of a [webserver](https://www.jpsr.pharmainfo.in/Documents/Volumes/vol3Issue12/jpsr%2003111204.pdf) to predict classes of snake `toxins`.

Apart from working full time, Nikunj enjoys `tutoring` and `mentoring` data science and computer science fundamentals to students and professionals as a part-time hobby. You can check out his public profile [here](https://www.firsttutors.com/ireland/tutor/nikunj.maths.computer-skills/).
