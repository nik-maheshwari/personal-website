Nikunj Maheshwari is a data scientist/machine learning specialist having worked in biotech, food, pharma and finance industry. Currently, Nikunj creates guided projects for Coursera on topics related to data science, machine learning and statistics. Before this, he was a data analytics manager at Bank of Ireland, Dublin. Prior to this role, he was a software developer/data scientist at [NIBRT](https://www.nibrt.ie), working on application of big data analytics in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Before NIBRT, he developed predictive pathogenic risk models for 5 leading Irish food manufacturers, which is under patent processing.

Nikunj holds a PhD in Computational Infection Biology where he computationally mined for lanthipeptide `antimicrobial` peptides from ~3000 `bacterial` genomes. He studied these peptide's evolution over time and between different bacterial taxonomy. The genome mining pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/nik-maheshwari/genome-mining). His other research projects include prediction of protein-protein interaction (during his Masters) and development of a [webserver](https://www.jpsr.pharmainfo.in/Documents/Volumes/vol3Issue12/jpsr%2003111204.pdf) to predict classes of snake `toxins`.

Apart from working full time, Nikunj enjoys `tutoring` and `mentoring` data science and computer science fundamentals to students and professionals as a part-time hobby. You can check out his public profile [here](https://www.firsttutors.com/ireland/tutor/nikunj.maths.computer-skills/).
