Nikunj Maheshwari is a software developer/data scientist at NIBRT, working on big data analytics in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Previously, he developed predictive risk models for 5 leading Irish food manufacturers, which is under patent processing.

Nikunj holds a PhD in Computational Infection Biology where he mined for lanthipeptide antimicrobial peptides from ~3000 bacterial genomes. He studied these peptide's evolution over time and between different bacterial taxonomy. The genome mining pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/nik-maheshwari/genome-mining). His other research projects include prediction of protein-protein interaction (during his Masters) and development of a [webserver](https://www.jpsr.pharmainfo.in/Documents/Volumes/vol3Issue12/jpsr%2003111204.pdf) to predict classes of snake toxins.

Apart from working full time, Nikunj enjoys teaching data science and computer science fundamentals to students and professionals. You can check out his public profile [here](https://www.firsttutors.com/ireland/tutor/nikunj.maths.computer-skills/).
