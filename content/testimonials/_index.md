My previous clients, ranging from `students` to leading `professionals`, have been extremely satisfied with my way of teaching, coupled with my experience and dedication. I have a 100% success rate i.e. when I decide to take on a client, I make sure they reach their end objective(s) (assignment/project/goal) and learn along the way.

Here are some of my clients' testimonials -

>_My experience with Nik has been `very positive`. He is very knowledgeable in all areas of `Data Analytics` and has a natural talent of being `clearly able to explain` the material._

>_He is a `real deal`! Super smart and super caring!_

>_I found Nik, `excellent to work with`, very `helpful` and a pleasure to collaborate with my particular need, being r `programming` and a really great ambassador for first tutors._

>_Nick was very `reliable` and `patient` and i would highly recommend him as a tutor._

>_Cannot recommend enough! We were able to cover a large amount of course material in such a short amount of time and nik was beyond helpful, I went from failing the class at midterms to achieving a high 2:1 overall in the module, and feel much `more comfortable progressing` in the maths element of my degree. Completely changed my whole attitude towards maths and can't thank him enough!_
