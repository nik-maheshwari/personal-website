My previous clients, ranging from `students` to leading `professionals`, have been extremely satisfied with my way of teaching, coupled with my experience and dedication. I have a 100% success rate i.e. when I decide to take on a client, I make sure they reach their end objective(s) (assignment/project/goal) and learn along the way.

Here are some of my clients' testimonials -

>_Excellent teacher! Great explanations, makes things easy to understand and patient._

>_Nik was very helpful when I was struggling with resitting a logic module in college. He outlined things very clearly and found lots of useful resources I could use to practice. He is also very friendly and the sessions were comfortable and informal._

>_My experience with Nik has been very positive. He is very knowledgeable in all areas of Data Analytics and has a natural talent of being clearly able to explain the material._

>_Nik is great tutor with an understanding of all aspects of computer science. I would definitely recommend him if you are a beginner of the subject like myself or just looking to build on existing knowledge. He does online tutoring too which is very useful. Highly recommended._

>_I found Nik, excellent to work with, very helpful and a pleasure to collaborate with my particular need, being r programming and a really great ambassador for first tutors._

>_Nikunj is a professional, who has the patience to explain topics in depth, while also having the punctuality and awareness of time management. He allows a mental bandwidth for each query that I have, even outside the session, so that we may follow up with the topics within the next session.
I would recommend Nikunj, as he has been very straightforward to work with, and has provided energy towards each session._

>_Cannot recommend enough! We were able to cover a large amount of course material in such a short amount of time and nik was beyond helpful, I went from failing the class at midterms to achieving a high 2:1 overall in the module, and feel much more comfortable progressing in the maths element of my degree. Completely changed my whole attitude towards maths and can't thank him enough!_
